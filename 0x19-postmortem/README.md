# Outage Postmortem

**Issue Summary:**

- **Duration:** August 10, 2023, 13:45 - August 10, 2023, 15:30 (UTC)
- **Impact:** The outage affected the main website service. Users experienced slow loading times, and approximately 25% of users encountered errors.

**Root Cause:**

The primary root cause was an unexpected surge in traffic due to a popular external link sharing our content.

**Timeline:**

- **13:45 (UTC):** Issue detected by monitoring alerts indicating increased server load.
- **13:50 (UTC):** Engineering team noticed slow website performance.
- **13:55 (UTC):** Investigation initiated, focusing on server performance and network traffic.
- **14:05 (UTC):** Assumed root cause was a possible DDoS attack due to the spike in incoming connections.
- **14:15 (UTC):** Incident escalated to the senior engineering team.
- **14:30 (UTC):** It was realized that the traffic surge was due to a popular external link sharing our content.
- **15:30 (UTC):** Issue resolved by adding additional server resources and optimizing code.

**Root Cause and Resolution:**

The root cause of the issue was a sudden influx of incoming traffic from an external source. The unexpected surge in requests exceeded the server's capacity, leading to slow response times and increased errors. The issue was resolved by addressing the following:

**Root Cause Analysis:** The investigation uncovered that the influx of traffic was due to a popular external link sharing our content. This external source did not inform us of their intention, leading to an unforeseen spike in incoming connections.

**Resolution:**

To address the issue and restore normal service, we took the following actions:

- Added additional server resources to handle the increased load.
- Implemented caching strategies to optimize content delivery.
- Reached out to the external source and requested coordination in case of future link sharing.

**Corrective and Preventative Measures:**

To prevent such issues from occurring in the future and improve our overall system, we have identified several corrective and preventative measures:

- **Traffic Spike Planning:** Develop a traffic scaling strategy to accommodate unexpected traffic spikes and ensure the system can dynamically allocate resources.
- **Monitoring and Alerts:** Enhance our monitoring system to provide more precise alerts when unusual traffic patterns are detected.
- **Collaboration with External Sources:** Establish communication channels with external sources that may share our content, allowing us to anticipate traffic surges.
- **Caching Strategies:** Improve and fine-tune our content caching strategies to optimize content delivery and minimize the load on servers.
- **Load Testing:** Conduct load testing regularly to ensure the system's ability to handle significant traffic increases.

**Conclusion:**

The outage on August 10, 2023, was a valuable learning experience. It highlighted the importance of being prepared for unexpected traffic surges and the need for better communication with external sources that share our content. By implementing the corrective and preventative measures outlined, we aim to enhance the resilience of our web stack and improve the user experience.
